# surfs_up

## Overview
This project aims to assess the feasibility of establishing a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. To conduct year-round weather analysis, we utilized various tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebook. As our investor is interested in the shop's long-term viability, we collected temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. The investor will use this data to determine if the business is sustainable throughout the year.

## Results

The examination of temperature data for the two specific time periods reveals the following findings:

- The average temperatures for both periods are relatively close, with June having an average temperature of 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit and December having an average of 71.04 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature does not appear to disqualify either time period for the operation of the surf and ice cream shop.

- The maximum temperatures for both periods are very close, June had a maximum temperature of 85 degrees Fahrenheit and December had a maximum of 83 degrees Fahrenheit. The maximum temperature would encourage the business if nothing else.

- The minimum temperature for June was 64 degrees Fahrenheit and 56 degrees Fahrenheit for December, this variability could be a factor in loss of sales on a year-round business. Although these temperatures could be at a time when business operations would not be active.


## Summary
The data shows that the surf and ice cream shop has a good chance at being successful year-round. The average temperatures did not vary by much for June and December. Even with the minimum temperature being 56 degrees Fahrenheit it would be unlikely to be a deal breaker as the average temperature is still high.


### Additional Queries
To acquire more data additional queries could be run.

- Building a query to analyze daily precipitation amounts for both months would ensure there would be no issue in opening the surf and ice cream shop.
- Alongside daily precipitation amounts it would be beneficial to build a query to look at precipitation on average by month, it is possible that a certain month would not be ideal due to excess precipitation.
